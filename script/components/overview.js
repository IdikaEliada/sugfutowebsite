            The Student Union Government (SUG) of the Federal University of Technology, Owerri (FUTO) is the official student-run body dedicated to representing the interests, rights, and welfare of over 30,000 Futoites.
            
            <br /><br />
            Established in [insert founding year, e.g., 1981 when FUTO was founded], SUG has been the heartbeat of campus activism, bridging the gap between students and the university administration. 
            
            <br />
            <br />From advocating for better hostel conditions to organizing skill-building workshops, we are committed to fostering a vibrant, inclusive, and progressive academic community. As of October 2025, under the leadership of the newly elected 2025/2026 executive team, we continue to uphold the spirit of 'Aluta Continua, Victoria Acerta'â€”the struggle continues, and victory is certain.
